# IoT & Embedded Systems Worksheets

This repository contains hands-on code worksheets and experiments for learning **Internet of Things (IoT)** concepts using **MicroPython** and **C**. 
The focus is on interfacing with microcontrollers like **Arduino** and working with **analog/digital sensors**, actuators, and communication protocols.

## ðŸ›  Topics Covered

### MicroPython Projects
- Basic digital I/O: reading buttons, toggling LEDs
- ADC/DAC usage for analog sensors
- PWM motor control
- I2C and SPI communication with peripheral modules
- Reading temperature, humidity, and light sensors
- Sending data over serial or Wi-Fi (ESP32/ESP8266)

### Arduino C Projects
- Analog sensor reading (e.g., potentiometer, thermistor)
- Actuator control (e.g., servo, DC motor)
- UART serial communication
- Interfacing
